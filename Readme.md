# Build smart contract
This learning process gave me a comprehensive foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. Practical exercises and progress updates on GitHub provided hands-on experience and resulted in a relevant portfolio. I learned to create ERC20 tokens, handle hashed messages on the blockchain, and automate smart contract interactions using ethers.js. Furthermore, I examined zkSync and paymasters for transaction fee management and token balance oversight.
